      <p class="about">
        Hello, and welcome to my profile!   I am a dedicated husband and father with a passion for adventure.  My personal interests include long-distance trail running, electronic dance music (EDM), motorcycles, and reading.  I have led an exciting and interesting 
        life thus far.  I was born and raised in rural Pennsylvania where my family instilled a love of the outdoors in me.  I was a member of the Boy Scouts of America where I learned many valuable lessons.
        One of the most important lessons I learned growing up is the value of hard work and persistence.  I began college in the traditional way immediately after highschool but left prior to completing a degree following the birth of my first child.
        I then relocated to Hawaii where I worked as a police officer for over 10 years.  During this career I served as a patrol officer, motorcycle traffic officer and as a drug-impaired driving enforcement expert and instructor.  
        Once my family life allowed it, I returned to college and resumed my pursuit of knowledge while continuing to work as a police officer.  
        I completed my Associates of Science in Natural Science degree at Leeward Community College where I was recognized two consecutive years by the American Chemical Society as an outstanding student in Chemistry.

      <p class="about">
          At this point, I reached a crossroads in my life where I faced a decision of continuing my career in law enforcement or pursuing higher education with an intent to change careers.  
        I chose to resign from my position as a police officer and relocate to Texas to continue my education.  I immediately enrolled in The Coding Boot Camp at the University of Texas and began my studies 2 days after arriving in Austin.
        During this course, I learned this skills of full-stack web development.  I intend to continue my education at the University of Texas with a final goal of earning a PhD in Chemistry.

      <p class="about"> 
        Thoughout my life, I have amassed a broad skill set including: critical thinking and observation, conflict resolution, public speaking, effective communication, and leadership.
        I have extensive knowledge of mathematics and natural sciences.  I have excelled as a lifelong learner with a demonstrated passion for the pursuit of self-improvement.  I am able to function effectively
        in the roles of leader, teacher, student, or teammate as situation dictates.
